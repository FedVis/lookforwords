Python - Game : This project tries to emulate a classic board game....
In the real game there is a box with dices inside, there are letters on every face of every dice, you mix them and then you have to find as many words in a certain time. 
Players write words they find and when the time is over they start to read words they 've found. Words that are found by more than one player have to be deleted from the list of every player. At the end every lasting word gives point to the player... Players can decide at the beginning if every word is 1 point or if every letter of words is 1 point or they can choose a different poit system for example 2-4 letters word: 1 point; 5-8 letters words: 2 point; and so on.
I want this project to be very simple, it should emulate the real board game showing random letters from emulated dices and a timer.
In Italy this game is known as "Il Paroliere" or also "Boggle", I emulated exactly real dices from the italian board game and there are 2 versions: 4X4 and 5X5 dices.
I wanna this game to be international, if the real board game exist in other languages I'd like people to be able to add letters from dices of their language or also to creat their own version of dices.
The game should run like this:
1: Players define a score system like described before
2: Players determine the time usefull to find words
3: Press F2 Key ("new game") to start a game
4: Players find words till the time has gone writing them on a paper. Words'letters have to be contiguos and cannot use a the same lettermore than once. 
5: At the end of the time every player read words and delete words that also other players found.
6: Sum point of every lasting word to get the total score
7: Press F2 and repeat until you want: time limit or a certain number of times or as long as you want
8: At the end the player with the highest score wins.

It's possible to play in teams, can be played from the computer's monitor or from a TV
